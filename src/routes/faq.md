## Who is the project owner?

The project doesn't have a single owner but is made up of a team of people. A list of the people involved and their positions can be found [on our members page](/members).

## One of your services contains toxic people!

You can contact us by mail or Matrix and we can figure this out with you. But we recommend that you put most of these requests in our support channel at [#support:projectsegfau.lt](https://matrix.to/#/#support:projectsegfau.lt) on Matrix. If it's something personal, just say that you have a report against someone on one of our services and you'd like to be contacted by an admin and we'll contact you as soon as possible. We generally tend to be active throughout the day.

## How can I trust your services?

Well, you really can't. We don't make our logs or anything else public, however, if you would like access to the data we have on you, please contact us. If you're extremely privacy/security conscious, **you are allowed to use Tor on our services**, but we don't host any `.onion` links.

## Which ways do you prefer to communicate?

Look at [Contact](/contact).
